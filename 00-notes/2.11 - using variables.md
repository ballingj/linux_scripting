Description: In this episode, Daniel and Don take a look at using
variables in your shell scripts. Here they will look at defining what

Using Variables
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ Using Variables
  - What is a variable?
    + A container to hold static or dynamic values
    + Environmental Variables
      - $PATH
      - $USER
      - $HOME
      - $UID
    + User Created Variables
      - Variables can be strings
        + `~$ var1=funzies`
        + `~$ echo $var1`
      - Variables can be multiple strings (aka sentences)
        + `~$ var1="Hello World!"`
      - Variables can be numbers/integers
        + `~$ var1=22`
      - Variables can be other variables
        + `~$ var1=22`
        + `~$ var2=$var1`
      - Variables can be the output of commands (command substitution)
        + `~$ var1=$(date)`
    + Command Substitution
      - variable contains output of a command
      - backticks
        + var1=\`date\`
      - $()
        + var1=$(date)
        + this is the suggested method
        + backticks look too much like single-quotes
    + Subshells
      - "child" shell
      - Doesn't have access to variables from parent shell
        + **EXAMPLE**: `subShell.sh`
      - using `./` to run scripts creates a subshell
        + `~$ shell1="Shell 1 Rocks!"`
        + `~$ ./subShell_2.sh`
          - `shell1` variable shouldn't display
