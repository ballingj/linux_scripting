Script Control Pt.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- `cron`
+ Job Scheduler for reoccurring jobs
+ `crontab -l` (Lists entries)
+ `crontab -e` (Creates entries)
- `cron` job format
  + minute hour dayofmonth month dayofweek command
    - July 4th 3:15am becomes
      + 15 3 4 7 * /home/user/scripts/dec_independance.sh
    - Used 24hr time
    - July 4th 3:15pm becomes
      + 15 15 4 7 * /home/user/scripts/dec_independance.sh
    - Full paths must be used
+ Pre-built `cron` directories
- `/etc/cron.monthly`
- `/etc/cron.weekly`
- `/etc/cron.daily`
- `/etc/cron.hourly`
  + Copy script to any of these folders and script will run at prescribed
    times
- `anacron`
+ Runs scripts that missed their target window
- Machine was down for whatever reason
+ `cat /etc/anacrontab`
- Entries for anacron
- Format
  + *period* *delay* *identifier* *command*
    - *period* = How often (in days) job should run
    - *delay* = Minutes computer should wait after startup to run missed jobs
    - *identifier* = Identify job in logs and err email with this description
    - *command* = Run this command
      + `run-parts` Runs all scripts in the directory passed to it
+ `cat /var/spool/anacron/cron.daily/weekly/monthly`
- Timestamps in these directories are tracked to see if jobs were missed
- `anacron` doesn't concern itself with .minutely
