discussion on loops in bash scripts. Here they cover changing
the Internal Field Separator(IFS) for various reasons, "C-style
for loops", "while loops", and "until loops".

Loops Pt.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Working with the **Internal Field Separator** (`$IFS`)
  + Environmental variable that defines characters that is used as field
    separator
    - *spaces*
    - *tabs*
    - *newlines*
  + Changing the `$IFS` is sometimes necessary
    - **EXAMPLE**: `for_IFS.sh` with `HolidayShopping.txt`
- C-style for loops
  + `for (( variable assignment; condition; iteration process ))`
  + Meant to be helpful to C programmers who are scripting in bash
  + Kind of like a `while` loop
    - Here's a variable (( a = 0; ))
    - Here's a condition (( a <= 10; )) *(while this is true, do this)*
    - Iterate this! (( a++ )) *(do this to variable and re-test condition)*
    - **EXAMPLE**: `for_Cstyle.sh`
    - **EXAMPLE**: `for_Cstyle_psweep.sh`
  + Using multiple variables
    - **EXAMPLE**: `for_multiVar_Cstyle.sh`


+ Loops: **while**
```
while [ test condition ]
do
  command(s)
done
```
- Very similar to the `if` conditional statement
  + Uses the `test` condition, then performs command(s)
  + Runs WHILE the condition is TRUE
- Simplifies the `if` code needed to get desired results
  + **EXAMPLE**: `while_if.sh` then `while.sh`
  + **EXAMPLE**: `while_psweep.sh`


+ Loops: **until**
```
until [ test condition ]
do
  command(s)
done
```
- The "opposite" of the `while` loop
  + Runs UNTIL the condition is TRUE
  + **EXAMPLE**: `until.sh`
  + **EXAMPLE**: `until_psweep.sh`
