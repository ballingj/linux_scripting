+ Description: In this episode, Daniel and Don take a look at using conditional 
logic statements in bash scripts. Here they pick back up by exploring nested if
statements and using the test condition; taking advantage test's condition classes
which includes, numeric comparisons, string comparisons, and file comparisons.

Conditional Statements Pt.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ Conditional Statements: **Nested if**
    ```
    if command
    then
      command(s)
      if command
      then
        command(s)
      elif command
      then
        command(s)
      else
        command(s)
      fi
    else
      command(s)
    fi
    ```
  - `if` statements inside of `if` statements
  - Expands decision making abilities
  - **EXAMPLE**: `netsted-if.sh`


+ Conditional Statements: **test**
  ```
  if test condition
  then
    command(s)
  fi
  ```
  - This is how `if` is able to evaluate TRUE|FALSE
  - Alternative to using `test` explicitly is by putting `condition` inside of
    square brackets `[]` like so...
    + `if [ condition ]`
  - Condition Classes
    + Numeric Comparisons
    + String Comparisons
    + File Comparisons
      - Numeric Comparisons
        + **EXAMPLE**: `numeric_comparisons.txt` (a look at the operators)
      - String Comparisons
        + **EXAMPLE**: `string_comparisons.txt`
        + String comparison looks at characters used, alphabetical order,
          upper/lower case, and punctuation. EVERYTHING must match!
      - File Comparisons
        + **EXAMPLE**: `file_comparisons.txt`
      - Let's take a look at using them in a script
        + **EXAMPLE**: `comparisons.sh` (shows examples of all three types)
