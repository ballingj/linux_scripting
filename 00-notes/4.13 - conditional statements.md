+ Description: In this episode, Daniel and Don take a look at using conditional 
logic statements in bash scripts. Here they finish their discussion by going 
over compound testing; employing boolean logic as well as when to use double
parenthesis(()) and/or double brackets[[]]. Finally they show you the case 
conditional statement, both its format and functions.

Conditional Statements Pt.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Compound Testing
  + Boolean logic
  + **EXAMPLE**: `compound_testing.sh` (demos AND as well as OR)
  + `[ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]` AND
    - BOTH conditions have to be TRUE
  + `[ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]` OR
    - EITHER condition has to be TRUE
- Double Parentheses `(())`
  + `if (( expression ))`
  + Used in advanced math formulas
    - `test` only allows for simple math
  + Operators
    - **EXAMPLE**: `double_parenth_symbols.txt`
    - **EXAMPLE**: `super_math.sh`
- Double Brackets `[[]]`
  + `if [[ expression ]]`
  + Used in advanced string comparisons
  + Can perform pattern matching (`test` cant pattern match)
    - Regular Expressions
    - **EXAMPLE**: `double_brack.sh` (compares $USER using regex)


+ Conditional Statements: **case**
```
case variable in
  pattern1 | pattern2) command(s)1;;
  pattern3) command(s)2;;
  *) default command(s);;
esac
```
  + Basically does the same thing as `if-then-else` and `if-elif-else`
  + More concise, less typing, and usually cleaner looking
    - **EXAMPLE**: `case_test1.sh` (doesn't do anything substantial, just a demo)
    - **EXAMPLE**: `case_dircheck.sh` (checks dirs for too many files)
