+ Description: In this episode, Daniel and Don take a look at using conditional 
logic statements in bash scripts. Here they will introduce you to working with 
if-then, if-then-else, and if-elif-else for complex decision making within scripts.

Conditional Statements Pt.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Conditional Statements: **if-then**
  ```
  if command
  then
    command(s)
  fi
  ```
  - Used to evaluate TRUE|FALSE and/or VALID|INVALID values
    + Whatever is directly to the right of the `if` is checked for TRUE|FALSE
      status, or exit status
    + If the statement/command is true/valid(*returns exit code of 0*), then the
      system executes whatever follows the `then` statement
      - Exiting a Script
        + Exit Status (*exit_status_codes.txt in Kali*)
          - An integer value between 0 and 255
            + Common Exit Status Codes
              -     0 - Command completed successfully
              -     1 - General unknown error
              -     2 - Misuse of shell command
              -   126 - Command CAN'T execute
              -   127 - Command not found
              -   128 - Invalid exit argument
              - 128+x - Fatal error with Linux signal x
              -   130 - Command terminated with Ctrl+c
              -   255 - Exit status out of range
          - Scripts exit with the exit status code of their last command
          - Enter a custom `exit` status into a script
            + Copy **logFile.sh** as **logFile2.sh**
            + Add custom `exit` code `222`
            + Run `logFile2.sh` and then check exit code status
            + Also works with variables
              - Assign a variable to `exit`
              - Change custom `exit` code to that of a variable
                + `var1=111`
                + `var2=222`
                + `exit $var1`
              - Rerun `logFile2.sh` and check exit code status
    + `if` statements are closed by the `fi`
  - **EXAMPLE**: `if-then1.sh` (easy working example)
  - **EXAMPLE**: `if-then2.sh` (non-working to see error)
  - **EXAMPLE**: `if-then1b.sh` (if command; then example)
  - **EXAMPLE**: `if-then3.sh`  (multiple commands after `then`)
  - **EXAMPLE**: `if-then3b.sh` (when `if` value is false/invalid, no script output)


+ Conditional Statements: **if-then-else**
  ```
  if command
  then
    command(s)
  else
    command(s)
  fi
  ```
  - Similar to standard *if-then*, but catches false/invalid statements/commands
    + Gives you the option to handle them in a user defined way instead of just
      exiting the script with no output
    + Great for catching problems with your `if` statements
  - **EXAMPLE**: `if-then-else1.sh` (easy working examples)

+ Conditional Statements: **if-elif-else**
  ```
  if command
  then
    command(s)
  elif command
  then
    command(s)
  else
    command(s)
  fi
  ```
  - Used to check multiple Statements
    + Increases the power/intelligence of your scripts
  - **EXAMPLE**: `if-elif-else1.sh`
