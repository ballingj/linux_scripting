+ Description: In this episode, Daniel and Justin continue looking at 
passing options to a shell script from the runline. Here they show you
how to employ getopt and getopts for expanding option functionality.
They also briefly discuss option standardization for better ease-of-use.

User Input: Options Pt.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Using the `getopt` command
  + Group options together
    - `command.sh -xyz`
  + Format
    - `getopt xyz`
    - `getopt x:yz`
      + the colon tells `getopt` to expect a *value*
  + Getting your script to use `getopt` output
    - Use the `set` command
    - `set -- $(getopt x:yz "$@")`
      + This changes the way that the command-line options are being
        interpreted.
        - `set` is telling the script to take *$1* and TRANSLATE it through
          `getopt xyz` or however it is stated
    - **EXAMPLE**: `cli_options_getopt.sh -x +%Y%M%D -yz parm1 parm2 parm3`
      + Maybe change this script in-show to be more simple, to use `-xyz`
- Advancing to `getopts`
  + SINGULAR `getopt` doesn't recognize <spaces> even with quotes
    - **EXAMPLE**: `cli_options_getopt.sh -yz "test parm1" parm2 parm3`
      + The first parameter should be `"test parm1"`
  + Never fear!  `getopts` (PLURAL) is here!
    - Is a bit more powerful than `getopt`
      + It can handle <spaces>
      + Sequentially iterates through the options using a while loop
        - Every time `getopts` runs it grabs the next option
        - The `while` loop does that well :)
      + Defines options much like `getopt`
        - `x:yz`
        - `:x:yz` Starting with a colon suppresses errors
      + Options are then placed into a variable
        - `getopts :x:yz var1`
      + Look at example
        - **EXAMPLE**: `vim cli_options_getopts.sh`
      + Employs 2 environmental variables
        - $OPTARG
          + Used if option *Value* is used
        - $OPTIND
          + Where `getopts` tracks the *Parameters*
      + Removes leading dashes
        - No need for dashes in the `case` function
          + -x) becomes x)
      + Any unknown option becomes a `?`
- Standardizing Options
  + You can make any options you like, BUT...
  + Standardizing the options you do use helps improve user experience
  + Let's look at some standard options
