+ Topic Name: Presenting Data
+ Episode Name: Presenting Data: File Descriptors
+ Description: In this episode, Daniel and Justin take another look 
at redirection, this time focusing on Linux File Descriptors for the
purposes of controlling user presented data. Here they will explain 
File Descriptors and then show the many ways in which we can 
redirect their output in a scripting context.

Presenting Data: File Descriptors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ File Descriptors
  - 0 STDIN   Standard In
  - 1 STDOUT  Standard Out
  - 2 STDERR  Standard Error
+ Redirection
  - \> (redirect output to)
  - < (redirect input to)
  - \>>
  - <<
  - We use these a lot when redirecting output to a file, or using the contents
    of a file as input to a command
  - We can also redirect STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR
    + By default STDERR and STDOUT are sent to your screen
    + By default STERR is **NOT** redirected when using > alone
      - It is printed to the screen
    + Redirecting STDERR
      - With scripts
        + Redirect STDERR to a logfile
          - **EXAMPLE**: `redir_stderr_logger.sh > sysVitals.log`
            + See STDERR at screen while STDOUT is redirected to logfile
            + We want to send errors to a logfile of its own
          - **EXAMPLE**: `redir_stderr_logger.sh > sysVitals.log 2>>sysVitals.err`
            + Now we are redirecting STDOUT and STDERR to their own logfiles
            + Could also do...
              - `redir_stderr_logger.sh 2>>sysVitals.err 1>sysVitals.log`
        + Redirect STDERR and STDOUT to logfile
          - **EXAMPLE**: `redir_stderr_logger.sh &>sysVitals2.log`
            + bash gives error messages priority
              - Will group errors together in output
        + Redirect STDOUT to logfile and screen simultaneously
          - **EXAMPLE**: `redir_tee.sh` then `cat log2.log`
        + Redirect from *inside* a script
          - No longer need to pass redirection from command line
          - Accomplished via the `exec` builtin
          - **EXAMPLE**: `redir_exec.sh`
        + Suppress Output with Redirection
          - `cat file.txt > /dev/null`
            + /dev/null is the bit-bucket, file13, nothingsville
          - You see this a lot when suppressing error messages in output
            + `cat /etc/* > etc-text.txt 2>/dev/null`
          - It's also an good way to empty a file programmatically
            + `cat /dev/null > file.txt`
