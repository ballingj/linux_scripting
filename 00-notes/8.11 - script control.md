+ Topic Name: Script Control
+ Episode Name: Script Control
+ Description: In this episode, Daniel and Justin show you how to control
script execution. Here they will explain and demonstrate running scripts 
as background jobs and employing "nohup" to ensure they run without 
interruption. They also tackle changing script priority using nice and 
renice. Finally, they look at scheduling script execution with "AT".

Script Control
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Running Scripts in the Background
  - Scripts that take time to execute can take over your terminal
  - Run them in the background to regain your terminal
    + `./script1.sh &`
  - Run multiple scripts by sending them to the background
  - Control with `jobs`
  - Scripts are tied to the terminal they're run from
    + Kill the terminal. Kill the script.
    + Use `nohup` to separate the job from the terminal
      - `nohup ./script1.sh &`
      - `nohup.out` records any STDERR or STDOUT since no terminal is present to
        receive them
+ Script Priority
  - CPU priority
    + -20 (highest priority) - +19 (lowest priority)
    + Default priority is 0
  - `nice`
    + Changes the priority of a process
    + Invoked at same time as command
      - `nice -n 10 ./script1.sh &` (lower priority to +10)
      - `nice -n -10 ./script1.sh &` (raise priority to -10)
        + Raising priority may require elevated privileges
    + Check `niceness`
      - `ps -a -o ppid,pid,ni,cmd,tty`
  - `renice`
    + Change the process of an already running process
    + Must know/use the Process ID(PID)
      - `renice -n 10 -p 14543`
    + Only renice scripts you own
    + Only lower priority
    + Requires root privs to raise priority
+ Scheduling Scripts
  - `at`
    + Job scheduler (1 time)
    + Checks its job queue every 60 seconds
    + `at -f script1.sh <time>`
      - Acceptable time format
        + 11:45AM/PM
        + 22:45
        + now, noon, midnight
        + MMDDYY, MM/DD/YY, MM.DD.YY
        + Apr 1, Jan 22
    + Check `at` job queue with `atq`
      - Each job has a job ID/number
    + `at` uses Sendmail to email results to user
      - This won't work if you don't use Sendmail
      - Suppress email with `-M`
      - Use redirection to get particulars
        + **EXAMPLE**: `at -f script2.sh now +1 minute`
    + Delete jobs with `atrm`
      - `atrm <job ID>`
