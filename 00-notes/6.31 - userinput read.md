+ Topic Name: User Input
+ Episode Name: User Input: Read
+ Description: In this episode, Daniel and Justin show you how to 
accept input from the user in real-time with "read". Here they will 
explore read's basic format and options, all the while showing you 
examples based on each function for context.

User Input: Read
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ User Interaction (Getting User Input with `read`)
  - `read variable`
    + `read` tells your script to accept input from STDIN
      - Input could come from the other file descriptors
    + User then types input
    + `read` then drops that input into the supplied variable
      - **EXAMPLE**: `read.sh`
    + `read -p` for prompt
      - **EXAMPLE**: `read_prompt.sh`
    + Multiple Variables
      - `read -p "User instruction" variable1 variable2`
      - **EXAMPLE**: `read_multiVar.sh`
    + No Variables
      - Defaults to the *$REPLY* environmental variable
      - **EXAMPLE**: `read_noVar.sh`
    + Timing out
      - Asks for user input, but times out after defined time span
        + Time in seconds
        + Does except fractions of a second
          - 0.2
          - 0.23
      - **EXAMPLE**: `read_timeout.sh`
    + Character Counting
      - Once the predetermined amount of characters are read, the `read`
        command enters input into variable
        + The ENTER key is not needed
      - **EXAMPLE**: `read_charCount.sh`
    + Silent Reading
      - Does not echo STDIN to STDOUT
        + Doesn't print typed characters to the screen
      - Good for when you don't want sensitive data printed to the screen
        + Passwords
        + Account Numbers
      - **EXAMPLE**: `read_silent.sh`
    + Reading from a File
      - Can help simplify code
        + Makes it easier to read and understand
      - `read` creates line by line "chunks"
      - `man builtins` then search for `/read \[-ers`
      - **EXAMPLE**: `read_file.sh`
