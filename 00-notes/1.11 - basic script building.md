Basic Script Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ **Q**:What is a script? **A**:String of commands run sequentially
+ One-liners
  - Simplest form of scripting
  - Commands separated by a semicolon
    + `~$ date; df; whomi`
    + `~$ date; echo; df; echo; whoami` (increased readability)
  - Check out http://www.bashoneliners.com
+ Script files
  - A file that contains our string of commands
  - Script file is executed > command string is executed
  - Proper script file format
    + Always start with the sha-bang `#!`
    + Follow that with `#!/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh` or `/bin/zsh`
    + \# used for comments everywhere else
    + Just add commands
      - Separate commands with semicolon or newline
+ Create `test1.sh` script
  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  date
  df
  whoami
  ```
+ Running your script
  - Make script executable
    + `chmod u+x test1.sh`
    + `chmod +x test1.sh`
  - Execute script
    + Simplest way
      - `./test1.sh`
      - `(bash/zsh/tcsh/csh/ksh/sh) test1.sh`
    + copy/move script to directory in $PATH
    + modify $PATH to include script directory
    + create a symbolic link from script to directory in $PATH
      - `ln -s test1.sh /usr/bin/test1.sh`
+ Output to the Screen
  - Using the `echo` command
  - Seen this already in our one-liner to separate output
  - `echo` will repeat anything you tell it
    + `echo Hello world`
    + `echo I'm Ron Burgundy?`
  - Using Quotes
    + `echo "I'm Ron Burgundy?"`
    + double-quote / single-quote "problem"
      - **EXAMPLE** Sentence: The "problem" with quotes.
      - Possible ways to `echo` this sentence:
        + `echo 'The "problem" with quotes.'`
        + `echo "The \"problem\" with quotes."`
