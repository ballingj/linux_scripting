Loops Pt.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ Loops: **Nesting Loops**
  - Loops inside loops
  - Inner and Outer loop
    + Outer: the main loop
    + Inner: secondary loop that COMPLETES before the Outer loop iterates/ends
    + **EXAMPLE**: `nest.sh`
  - Mix and match loops when nesting
    + **EXAMPLE**: `nest_mix.sh`


+ Loops: **break** and **continue**
  - `break` allows you to exit a loop prematurely
    + Helpful for times when there is no good reason to continue the loop
      - Desired condition/result/value is met, yet loop iterations not complete
      - **EXAMPLE**: `break_loop.sh`
      - **EXAMPLE**: `checker.sh`
    + `break` inner and outer loops
      - `break n`, `break 2`
        + n defaults to 1 which breaks the current loop
        + changing n works its way out
  - `continue` stops the loop from processing (not from iterating)
